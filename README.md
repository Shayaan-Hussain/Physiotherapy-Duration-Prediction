## ***About the Project:***
This was my first project in the Machine Learning (ML) Domain. The project is aimed at the determination of the duration of physiotherapy required for a person to heal.
The project involved development of various ML models. The best accuracy was achieved by the Decision Tree Model with a max_depth of 9<br/><br/>

## ***About the Dataset Used:***
The dataset was collected from a known physiotherapist with The following feature columns:
<ul>
  <li>Age</li>
  <li>Affected Body Part</li>
  <li>Diagnosis</li>
  <li>Duration of Pain</li>
  <li>Intensity of Pain (on NPRS Scale)</li>
  <li>Treatment Approach</li>
</ul>
